abstract={Increasing renewable energy sources and innovative information and communication systems open up new challenges and opportunities to integrate distributed generation into the energy supply system. Formerly centralized energy systems need to be adapted to take full advantage of the immense potential of decentralized energy generation and smart, interconnected energy end users. We introduce a local electricity market on which prosumers and consumers of a community are able to trade electricity directly amongst each other. This local electricity market supports the local integration of renewable energy generation. It facilitates a local balance of energy supply and demand and hence reduces the need for extensive electricity transmission. We introduce, evaluate and compare two local market designs, a direct peer-to-peer market and a closed order book market, as well as two agent behaviors, zero-intelligence agents and intelligently bidding agents. We derive four scenarios by combining each market design with each agent behavior, respectively. All market scenarios offer similar economic advantages for the market participants. However, the peer-to-peer market with intelligent agents appears to be the most advantageous as it results in the lowest average overall electricity price.},

abstract={Future electricity distribution grids will host a considerable share of variable renewable energy sources and local storage resources. Moreover, they will face new load structures due for example to the growth of the electric vehicle market. These trends raise the need for new paradigms for distribution grids operation, in which Distribution System Operators will increasingly rely on demand side flexibility and households will progressively become prosumers playing an active role on smart grid energy management. However, in present energy management architectures, the lack of coordination among actors limits the capability of the grid to enable the mentioned trends. In this paper we tackle this problem by proposing an architecture that enables households to autonomously exchange energy blocks and flexibility services with neighbors, operators and market actors. The solution is based on a blockchain transactive platform. We focus on a market application, where households can trade energy with their neighbors, aimed to locally balancing renewable energy production. We propose a market mechanism and dynamic transport prices that provide an incentive for households to locally manage energy resources in a way that responds to both prosumer and operator needs. We evaluate the impact of such markets through comprehensive simulations using power flow analysis and realistic load profiles, providing valuable insight for the design of appropriate mechanisms and incentives.},
